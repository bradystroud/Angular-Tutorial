# AngularTourOfHeroes

I followed [this](https://angular.io/tutorial) to start learning Angular. It gave me a good outline of the pros and cons Angular, and also the things I need to learn more about.

### Angular Review:
  * The binding between objects and HTML is much easier than ASP.NET Core. I think it might be because TS is very well intergrated into building for the web, unlike C#.
  * TS syntax has some Swift-like attributes that bring back mixed memories.
  * There is a good community around it, which is always nice when learning something new.
