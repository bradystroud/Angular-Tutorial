# AngularTourOfHeroes

I am following [this](https://angular.io/tutorial) tutorial to learn angular.
So far it's going pretty well, I haven't done much JS so TS is very new to me.

### Angular Review:
  * The binding between objects and HTML is much easier than ASP.NET Core. I think it might be because TS is very well intergrated into building for the web, unlike C#.
  * TS syntax has some Swift-like attributes that bring back mixed memories.
  * There is a good community around it, which is always nice when learning something new.
